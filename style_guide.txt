Below is a rough style guide to keep in mind when developing/maintaining code. This is more for my benefit so I remember why things are a certain way.

- Always use 4-space indents in Python and shell scripts
- Try to obey pep8 styling (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
- For terminal colours,
  - print warnings in bold yellow
  - print statements signifying ongoing processes or printing the config file in yellow
  - exceptions or built-in Python errors (ValueError etc.) in green
  - print statements signifying important finished processes in magenta
- Decide on whether to use snake case (this_is_the_file) or camel case (ThisIsTheFile/thisIsTheFile) in files and code. Different types can be used in different situations
- Add shebangs to executable Python and shell scripts
- Add imports to Python scripts in alphabetical order
