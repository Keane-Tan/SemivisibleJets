# Semi-visible Jets

[![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-1707.05326%20-green.svg)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05326)

This repository contains model files necessary for generation of semi-visible jet Monte Carlo signal events in `MadGraph`. 
Please see [1707.05326](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05326) and [1503.00009](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00009) for
for further details. Please note that a recent version of `PYTHIA` (> 8.226) including the Hidden Valley module 
and running of the dark coupling is required when implementing the subsequent dark hadronization.

UFO files associated with two UV completions are provided:

### s-channel production

An s-channel production (`DMsimp_s_spin1`) mediated through a new heavy Z'. The model provided is a modified version of the spin-1 `DMsimp` model (http://feynrules.irmp.ucl.ac.be/wiki/DMsimp) 
implemented through `FeynRules`.

### t-channel production

A t-channel production (`DMsimp_tchannel`) where the dark and visible sectors interact through a new scalar bi-fundamental.

The bi-fundamentals are denoted with `su11, su12, su21, su22...`, where `u` etc explicitly specifies the QCD flavour index 
and the numbers are the explicit dark non-Abelian group indices. Similarly, the dark quarks are labeled as `qv11, qv12, qv21, qv22`.

Please note that a modified version of `MadGraph` using the patch included [here](https://bugs.launchpad.net/mg5amcnlo/+bug/1702712) 
is required to ensure a stable cross section for event generation using this model.

A `FeynRules` model file (`DMsimp_tchannel.fr`) as well as the `Mathematica` notebook (`DMsimp_tchannel.nb`) used to generated the UFO output 
are also provided.

## Example `MadGraph` production

- Inclusive s-channel production:
```
import DMsimp_s_spin1
define j = g u c t d b s g u~ c~ t~ d~ b~ s~
generate p p > xd xd~
add process p p > xd xd~Â j
add process p p > xd xd~ j j
output sig_schannel
```
- Inclusive t-channel production:
```
import DMsimp_tchannel
define gv = gv11 gv12 gv21 gv22
define gv~ = gv11~ gv12~ gv21~ gv22~
define j = g u c t d b s g u~ c~ t~ d~ b~ s~
generate p p > gv gv~
add process p p > gv gv~ j
add process p p > gv gv~ j j
output sig_tchannel
```
